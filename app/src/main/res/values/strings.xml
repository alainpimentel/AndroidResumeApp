    <string name="introduction">I recently graduated with a BS in CS and Math. My passion in the developer world is Android. Activities, fragments, Material Design, you name it. But no Android app should be alone, I can also work with its good companions: databases, REST APIs and JSON.\nWhen I\'m not programming you will find me playing soccer, talking about Game of Thrones, playing FIFA with my mates, or climbing (still too noob).</string>
